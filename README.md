# Microbiomes across a Climate Gradient

**Applying [DEMENTpy](https://github.com/bioatmosphere/DEMENTpy) to the climate gradient in Southern California (USA) to disentangle mechanisms underpining relationships between community composition and functioning in soil microbial systems**

To appear in **Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution**: [Link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2022.841824)

**NOTE**: code and organization of this repo will be finallized in the comming few days as the ms gets published formally. Please use caution for now!
