# Soil Microbiomes' Constraints, Tradeoffs, and Strategies 

**Applying [DEMENTpy](https://github.com/bioatmosphere/DEMENTpy) to a climate gradient in Southern California to disentangle trait-based mechanisms underpining relationships between community composition and functioning in soil microbial systems**

![Location of sites across the gradient](https://github.com/bioatmosphere/microbiome-climate-gradient/blob/master/inputs/site_information/figures/site_location.jpg)

## inputs
- 5 folders, each for one of the 5 sites:

- site_information:

- automation: bash scripts automating data transfer between local and remote machine
