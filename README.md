## Soil Microbiomes' Constraints, Tradeoffs, and Strategies 

An application of DEMENTpy along a climate gradient in Southern California, USA. It offers a hypothesis that a unified, data-driven model of trait-based prediction of litter decomposition across scales can be developed. This trait-based can integrate climate-driven microbiome legacies.
