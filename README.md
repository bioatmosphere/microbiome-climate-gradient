# Microbiomes across a Climate Gradient

**Applying [DEMENTpy](https://github.com/bioatmosphere/DEMENTpy) to the climate gradient in Southern California to disentangle mechanisms underpining relationships between community composition and functioning in soil microbial systems**

To appear in **Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution**[Link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2022.841824)
